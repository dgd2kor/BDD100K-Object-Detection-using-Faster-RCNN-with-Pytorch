# BDD100K Data Analysis  

## 1.Overview  
This document presents an analysis of the **BDD100K dataset** for object detection.  
The dataset contains labeled images with bounding boxes for different object categories.  
The goal of this analysis is to understand the **distribution of objects** and identify potential **data imbalances** or **anomalies**.  

## 2.Dataset Statistics  

The dataset contains the following object categories and their respective counts:  

| Category           | Count    | Observations |
|-------------------|---------|-------------|
| **Car**        | 713,211  | Most common object in dataset. |
| **Lane**       | 528,643  | Important for road scene understanding and segmentation. Ignore for Object detection.|
| **Traffic Sign** | 239,686  | High occurrence, indicating significant scene variability. |
| **Traffic Light** | 186,117  | Distributed across different lighting conditions. |
| **Drivable Area** | 125,723  | Provides semantic segmentation context. Ignore for Object detection.|
| **Person**     | 91,349   | Important for pedestrian detection, relatively fewer samples than vehicles. |
| **Truck**      | 29,971   | Less frequent compared to cars, could lead to class imbalance. |
| **Bus**        | 11,672   | Relatively low occurrence, needs augmentation strategies. |
| **Bike**       | 7,210    | Low count, potential underrepresentation of non-motorized vehicles. |
| **Rider**      | 4,517    | Underrepresented category, model may struggle to detect riders. |
| **Motorcycle** | 3,002    | Very low frequency, model may struggle to detect motorcycles. |
| **Train**      | 136      | Extremely rare class, unlikely to contribute significantly to model learning. |



### Observations:  
**1.Imbalance in Object Categories:**  
   - The dataset is **heavily skewed** towards **cars, lanes, and traffic signs**.  
   - **Trucks, buses, motorcycles, and trains** have significantly **fewer samples**.  
   - The model may struggle to detect **rare objects** like **motorcycles, riders, and trains**.  


## 3.Anomalies & Unique Patterns  

### Key Anomalies Identified:  
- **Extremely low occurrence** of **"Train" (136 samples)** – The dataset might **not be suitable** for detecting trains effectively.  
- **Underrepresentation of motorcycles and riders** – May lead to **poor model performance for two-wheelers**.  
- **Lane detection is highly dominant** – Useful for **autonomous driving**, but may **bias the model towards lane-related objects**.  

## 4.Next Steps  

### Preprocessing Recommendations:  
- **Use class balancing techniques** to improve learning for **underrepresented categories**.  
- **Apply augmentation** (synthetic data, random cropping, flipping) to **increase diversity**.  
- **Experiment with different loss functions** (e.g., **Focal Loss**) to handle **class imbalance**.  

### Model Training Considerations:  
- **Track per-class mAP** to analyze how well **rare objects** are detected.  
- **Evaluate false positives and false negatives** to refine **model predictions**.  
- **Consider fine-tuning with additional datasets** that contain more samples for **underrepresented classes**.

## 5.Summary  

- The dataset is **dominated** by **cars, lanes, and traffic signs**, leading to a **class imbalance**.  
- **Rare objects** (e.g., **trains, motorcycles, riders**) may be difficult to detect without **additional training techniques**.  
- The next steps involve **balancing the dataset, improving augmentation, and fine-tuning model training**.
